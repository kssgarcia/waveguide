ABSTRACT = {With the aim of selecting particular frequencies of interest and rejecting others, the waveguiding and filtering properties of a two-dimensional phononic crystal slab are investigated in the context of a filtering application. To this end, we designed and manufactured a metallic device that consists of a square lattice of cylindrical pillars mounted on the top of a plate by using 3D printing technology. We respectively explored the theoretical and experimental characteristics of the device by using finite element method, a Micro System Analyzer (MSA) and a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer. The proposed device shows a complete band gap for Lamb wave around 0.3 MHz with a relative band-width of 30 % . Tailorable waveguides are realized inside this phononic crystal by inserting several space gaps to achieve a demultiplexing effect through the splitting of an acoustic signal towards three different bandpass frequency channels. The demultiplexing performance has been experimentally demonstrated by achieving rejection levels up to 60 dB. The proposed phononic platform can have a significant impact in signal processing as well as droplet manipulation for biological applications.},
